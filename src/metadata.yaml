summary: Virtual Accelerator provides packet processing acceleration.
maintainer: Pascal Mazon <pascal.mazon@6wind.com>
description: |
  Virtual Accelerator provides low latency and high networking throughput
  while offloading the virtual switching from the Openstack hypervisor
  networking stack (Neutron).
  The CPU resources necessary for packet processing are drastically reduced, so that
  less cores are required to process network traffic at higher rates.
  It allows a better determinism for your performances.

  Virtual Accelerator is fully integrated with Linux and its environment, so
  that your existing Linux networking scenario does not need to be modified to
  benefit from packet processing acceleration. For instance, you can still
  use Linux bridges, OVS, iptables or IPsec and you still benefit from networking
  acceleration for your VMs.
